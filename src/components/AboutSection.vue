      <h2>About Reaction Time Test</h2>
      <p>
        The reaction time test tool measures the speed at which an individual responds to a visual stimulus. Users need to click on the screen when the red color turns to green, providing immediate feedback on reaction speed.
      </p>
      <h3>What Is Reaction Time?</h3>
      <p>
        Reaction time is the period required for a person to react to a given stimulus. It begins when the stimulus is detected and ends when a response is executed. Reaction time is essential in everyday life as it influences our ability to perform tasks efficiently and safely.
      </p>
      <h3>How to Use the Online Reaction Time Test?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Start the Test: Visit the reaction time test tool and click anywhere on the blue screen to start the test.</li>
        <li>Wait for the Green Screen: The screen will first turn red. Wait patiently without clicking.</li>
        <li>React Quickly: As soon as the screen turns green, click as quickly as you can. Your reaction time will be measured from the moment the screen changes color.</li>
        <li>View Your Results: After clicking, your actual reaction time will be displayed in milliseconds. Use this feedback to track your progress and aim for improvements.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How to Interpret Your Reaction Time Test Results?</h3>
      <p>
        Decoding your Reaction Time Test results provides valuable insights into your neurological efficiency and sensorimotor performance.
